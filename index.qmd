## Description

This workshop is hosted by the PACCSM Pulmonary Translational Research Core (PTRC). The purpose is to

\- get you familiar enough with R so you can direct further study

\- focus on in-session hands-on exercises with real data

\- provide a work environment so you don't need to install software

\- start with best practices

The design is flipped so sessions are hands-on while the materials are preparatory and optional.

## Materials

All the materials we'll use in this workshop are in this RStudio project. You can open this project in your browser without needing to install or download anything on your computer. Open this RStudio.cloud project (you'll need to create a free account really quick):

## Schedule

This workshop is virtual-first, but we will meet in-person pending location availability.

We will use Pitt's Zoom [service](https://pitt.zoom.us/j/97006092281) and make the recordings available internally.
